# FolderComparer

Allows you to compare 2 folders or drives to see diffrence between the files. 


this was made in order to ensure my backup drive and its reduency plan another back up driver where uptodate with each other and in synch hence the name


todo will move the file copy and directory copy to a background task so does not lock up the main thread.



## Please note
this was done in this version of .net so it was compatible with mono as all \ majority of the development for this was done on linux meaning visual studio designer for forms will probably not work as all forms and controls where done by hand.
