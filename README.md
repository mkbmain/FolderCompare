# FolderComparer

Allows you to compare 2 folders or drives to see differences between the files and folders. 


This was made in order to ensure my backup drive and it's redundancy plan, another back up drive were up to date with each other and in synch.

It seems to work fairly well 


# Find difference in files
<p>Select Path Let it run </p>

This was done in this version of .net so it was compatible with mono as all \ majority of the development for this was done on linux meaning visual studio designer for forms will probably not work as all forms and controls where done by hand.
